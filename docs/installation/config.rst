===================================
Environment configuration reference
===================================

Open Forms can be ran both as a Docker container or directly on a VPS or
dedicated server. It depends on other services, such as database and cache
backends, which can be configured through environment variables.

Available environment variables
===============================

  should generate one via
  `miniwebtool <https://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/>`_

  serve the installation. Used to protect against ``Host`` header attacks.
  Defaults to ``*`` for the ``docker`` environment and defaults to
  ``127.0.0.1,localhost`` for the ``dev`` environment.

* ``EHERKENNING_METADATA``: Path to the metadata file provided by the Identity Provider.
* ``EHERKENNING_SERVICE_ENTITY_ID``: Value that matches the `entityID` attribute in the `md:EntityDescriptor` tag of the Identity Provider metadata.
* ``EHERKENNING_ENTITY_ID``: It has the format `urn:etoegang:DV:<OIN>:entities:<index>`. More information can be found `here <https://afsprakenstelsel.etoegang.nl/display/as/EntityID>`__.
* ``EHERKENNING_LOA``: LOA stands for 'Level Of Assurance'. The possible values can be found `here <https://afsprakenstelsel.etoegang.nl/display/as/Level+of+assurance>`__. Defaults to `"urn:etoegang:core:assurance-class:loa3"`.

Other settings
--------------

* ``DEBUG``: Used for more traceback information on development environment.
  Various other security settings are derived from this setting! Defaults to
  ``True`` for the ``dev`` environment, otherwise defaults to ``False``.

* ``IS_HTTPS``: Used to construct absolute URLs and controls a variety of
  security settings. Defaults to the inverse of ``DEBUG``.

* ``DB_ENGINE``: Backend to use as database system. See
  `Django DATABASE settings`_ for a full list of backends. Only the default is
  supported but others might work. Defaults to ``django.db.backends.postgresql``

* ``CACHE_DEFAULT``: The default Redis cache location. Defaults to
  ``localhost:6379/0``.

* ``CACHE_AXES``: The Redis cache location for Axes (used to prevent brute
  force attacks). Defaults to ``localhost:6379/0``.

  etc.) Defaults to ``""``.

* ``GIT_SHA``: The Git commit hash belonging to the code running the instance.
  Defaults to the automatically determined commit hash, if the application is
  run from a checked out Git repository.

* ``VERSION_TAG``: The version of the application. If not provided, the
  ``GIT_SHA`` is used.

* ``EXTRA_VERIFY_CERTS``: a comma-separated list of paths to certificates to trust, empty
  by default. If you're using self-signed certificates for the services that Open Forms
  communicates with, specify the path to those (root) certificates here, rather than
  disabling SSL certificate verification. Example:
  ``EXTRA_VERIFY_CERTS=/etc/ssl/root1.crt,/etc/ssl/root2.crt``.

* ``CURL_CA_BUNDLE``: if this variable is set to an empty string, it disables SSL/TLS
  certificate verification. More information about why can be found on this
  `stackoverflow post <https://stackoverflow.com/a/48391751/7146757>`_. Even calls from
  Open Forms to any other service will be disabled, so this variable should be used with
  care to prevent unwanted side-effects.

Specifying the environment variables
=====================================

There are two strategies to specify the environment variables:

* provide them in a ``.env`` file
* start the component processes (with uwsgi/gunicorn/celery) in a process
  manager that defines the environment variables

Providing a .env file
---------------------

This is the most simple setup and easiest to debug. The ``.env`` file must be
at the root of the project - i.e. on the same level as the ``src`` directory (
NOT *in* the ``src`` directory).

The syntax is key-value:

.. code::

   SOME_VAR=some_value
   OTHER_VAR="quoted_value"


Provide the envvars via the process manager
-------------------------------------------

If you use a process manager (such as supervisor/systemd), use their techniques
to define the envvars. The component will pick them up out of the box.
